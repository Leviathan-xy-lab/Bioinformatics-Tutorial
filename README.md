# 🧬 Bioinformatics Learning Journey  

Welcome to my **Bioinformatics Tutorial Repository**!  
This is a continuously updated space where I share what I learn, practice, and reflect on throughout my journey in bioinformatics.

## 👨‍🔬 About Me  
I am Leviathan，a doctoral student in **cardiac surgery**, focusing on **cardiovascular diseases** with particular interests in:  
- 🫀 **Heart transplantation**  
- 💡 **Heart regeneration**  
- 🔬 **Molecular mechanisms of cardiovascular pathology**  

My research integrates:  
- **Wet-lab experiments** (cell biology, stem cells, surgical models)  
- **Bioinformatics and omics approaches** (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, single-cell, spatial omics, etc.)

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository  
This repository serves as:  
- 📓 **A daily learning log** – recording insights, notes, and tutorials on bioinformatics.  
- 🧩 **A collection of methods** – including scripts, pipelines, and tools I find useful.  
- 🚀 **A motivator for consistency** – by documenting progress publicly, I keep myself accountable.  
- 🤝 **A resource for others** – to share practical knowledge with fellow students, researchers, and bioinformatics enthusiasts.

## 📚 Topics Covered  
This repository will gradually include:  
- Basics of bioinformatics (Linux, R, Python)  
- Data preprocessing and quality control  
- Bulk and single-cell RNA-seq analysis  
- Epigenomics (ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, DNA methylation)  
- Proteomics & metabolomics  
- Integrative multi-omics approaches  
- Data visualization and reproducibility practices  

---

## 📅 Update Style  
- New content is added **daily (or near-daily)**.  
- Each update will include a short explanation, code snippets (if applicable), and insights gained.  
- Over time, this will form a **comprehensive, evolving tutorial series**.
